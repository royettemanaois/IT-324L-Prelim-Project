        <h3>Challenges:</h3>
		<p>
    <ul>
	Dog waste is the most common problem in the barangay right now . The abundancy of it make the streets and neighborhood stinky which causes an unnattractive and unhealthy place because of bacteria, students in the area are most affected
	because it makes the place not efficient for learning. The barangay is doing their best to solve it by having a clean-up everyday and making sure that the owners are cleaning their dog's waste but there are owners that are not following rules and still don't care when the stool of their pets are left
        on the streets. </ul>
    <ul>Garbage that is thrown everywhere is the next problem adding the stinkiness and bacteria caused by the dog's waste it gets worse, for that the barangay has a solid-waste management act and also a clean-up everyday to make sure
    the streets are clean. but with all the efforts of the barangay the problems still persists. </ul>

        The barangay will place a "recycling bin/zone"where residents of the barangay can drop, plastic bottles, papers, boxes or any other recyclables. 
        These recyclables can then be brought to a recycling center for them to be repurposed. Residents will also be advised
        to ditch the plastic bags and start using eco bags instead. 
        Residents can also start composting, usually a large amount
        of what we throw in the trash could be composted.
        With just a bin and a small space, you are good to go.
