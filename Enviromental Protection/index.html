 +		Clean-up drive - Since the clean up drive will be a community-based project, it will inspire and motivate 
 +				the environmental initiative of the people. This drive will include the following activities:
 +					-Removing litter from the public areas of the barangay, and even in the respective 
 +					houses of the residents.
 +					-Clearing illegal waste dumps that are usually heaped at street corners.
 +					-Placing trash cans around the barangay.
 +				 The objectives of the clean-up drive are the following:
 +				 	- To ensure a safe, clean, and healthy environment.
 +					- To promote environmental awareness
 +					- To eradicate diseases thay a dirty environment may bring to the community
 +					- To engange the residents of Barangay Lopez Jaena in long term environmental initiatives.
 +				 
 +		"Aso mo tali mo" - As per REPUBLIC ACT No. 9482 anyone who violates this ordinance will be fined 
 +					5OO PHP per violation.
 +					
 +		Seminar on how to take responsibility of your pet. - A seminar for all dog owners in the barangay will be held, they 			will be informed about their responsibilites as pet owners including the stated responsibilities in Section 5 of the 
 +		REPUBLIC ACT No. 9482:
 +			Sec. 5. Responsibilities of Pet Owner. - All Pet Owners shall be required to:

 +				(f) Assist the Dog bite victim immediately and shoulder the medical expenses incurred and other 					incidental expenses relative to the victim’s injuries.
  
 +			
  		
 +		Waste reduction and recycling - Since waste is a growing problem in the Barangay, educating the community on ways how to 						reduce their wastes will be a big help. The barangay will place a "recycling bin/zone"  						where residents of the barangay can drop, plastic bottles, papers, boxes or any other 						       recyclables. These recyclables can then be brought to a recycling center for them to be
 +					       repurposed. Residents will also be advised to ditch the plastic bags and start using eco 					       bags instead. Residents can also start composting, usually a large amount of what we     
 					       throw in the trash could be composted. With just a bin and a small space, you are good to 
					       go. 
 					       
 		Posters/Slogans about community waste management - Posters/Slogans that will help motivate the residents of the 			community will be placed in different areas of the barangay.
