	THE 1987 CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES – ARTICLE III

		the laws.

		Section 2. The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures of 
		whatever nature and for any purpose shall be inviolable, and no search warrant or warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be 
		determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly 
		describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.

		Section 3. (1) The privacy of communication and correspondence shall be inviolable 	except upon lawful order of the court, or when public safety or 
		order requires otherwise, as prescribed by law.

		(2) Any evidence obtained in violation of this or the preceding section shall be inadmissible for any purpose in any proceeding.

		Section 4. No law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech, of expression, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble 
		and petition the government for redress of grievances.

		Section 5. No law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The free exercise and enjoyment of 
		religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed. No religious test shall be required for the exercise 
		of civil or political rights.

		Section 6. The liberty of abode and of changing the same within the limits prescribed by law shall not be impaired except upon lawful order of the 
		court. Neither shall the right to travel be impaired except in the interest of national security, public safety, or public health, as may be provided 
		by law.

		Section 7. The right of the people to information on matters of public concern shall be recognized. Access to official records, and to documents and 
		papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decisions, as well as to government research data used as basis for policy development, shall be 
		afforded the citizen, subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.

		Section 8. The right of the people, including those employed in the public and private sectors, to form unions, associations, or societies for purposes 
		not contrary to law shall not be abridged.

		poverty.

		Section 12. (1) Any person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right to be informed of his right to remain silent and 
		to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice. If the person cannot afford the services of counsel, he must be provided 
		with one. These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel.

		(2) No torture, force, violence, threat, intimidation, or any other means which vitiate the free will shall be used against him. Secret detention places, 
		solitary, incommunicado, or other similar forms of detention are prohibited.

		(3) Any confession or admission obtained in violation of this or Section 17 hereof shall be inadmissible in evidence against him.

		(4) The law shall provide for penal and civil sanctions for violations of this section as well as compensation to and rehabilitation of victims of torture 
		or similar practices, and their families.

		Section 13. All persons, except those charged with offenses punishable by reclusion perpetua when evidence of guilt is strong, shall, before 
		conviction, be bailable by sufficient sureties, or be released on recognizance as may be provided by law. The right to bail shall not be impaired even 
		when the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is suspended. Excessive bail shall not be required.

		Section 14. (1) No person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law.

		(2) In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved, and shall enjoy the right to be heard by himself 
		and counsel, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to have a speedy, impartial, and public trial, to meet the 
		witnesses face to face, and to have compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence in his behalf. 
		However, after arraignment, trial may proceed notwithstanding the absence of the accused provided that he has been duly notified and his failure to 
		appear is unjustifiable.

		imposed, unless, for compelling reasons involving heinous crimes, the Congress hereafter provides for it. Any death penalty already imposed shall
		be reduced to reclusion perpetua.
