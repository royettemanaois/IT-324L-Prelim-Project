CHALLENGES:
	Dog waste is the most common problem in the barangay right now . The abundancy of it make the streets and neighborhood stinky which causes an unnattractive place especially for students that it makes the place not efficient for learning.
	 The barangay is doing their best to solve it by having a clean-up everyday and making sure that the owners are cleaning their dog's waste.
	Garbage that is thrown everywhere is the next problem adding the stinkiness caused by the dog waste it gets worse for that the barangay has a solid-waste management act and also a clean-up everyday to make sure the streets are clean.
	but with all the efforts of the barangay the problems still persists.
